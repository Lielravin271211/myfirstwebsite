  <h1>Welcome to Fencing World!</h1>
  <h2>Your one-stop shop for all things fencing!</h2>
  <p>Fencing is a sport that involves two competitors fighting with swords. The objective is to score points by making contact with the opponent while avoiding being hit yourself. Fencing is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires quick reflexes, agility, and strategy.</p>
  <p>There are three main types of fencing: foil, epee, and sabre. Each type has its own set of rules and techniques, but all three require a combination of speed, precision, and endurance.</p>
  <p>Fencing is a great way to stay active and improve your coordination and balance. It also teaches important life skills such as discipline, focus, and sportsmanship.</p>
