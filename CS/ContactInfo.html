    <h1>These are the basics that you need to know to fence with an epee.</h1>

    <p>The epee is a thrusting weapon that targets the entire body, including the arms and legs.</p>

    <p>Even though the epee and foil look similar, the epee is heavier and has a stiffer blade.</p>

    <p>Points are scored by making contact with the tip of the blade on any part of the opponent's body.</p>

    <p>You can even score by hitting the opponent's hand.</p>

    <p>Unlike foil and sabre fencing, epee fencing does not follow the rules of "right of way." This means that both fencers can score a point simultaneously if they make contact at the same time.</p>

    <p>Epee fencing is typically done in a series of three-minute bouts, with the winner being the first to score 15 points or the fencer with the most points at the end of the time limit.</p>
