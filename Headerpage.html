  <h1>These are the basics that you need to know to fence with a foil.</h1>

  <p>The foil is a sharp thrusting weapon that targets the torso, including the back, but not the arms or legs.</p>

  <p>Points are scored by making contact with the tip of the blade on the opponent's valid target area.</p> 
  
  <p>Foil fencing follows the rules of "right of way," which means that the fencer who initiates an attack has priority to score a point.</p>
  
  <p>Even though the epee and foil look similar, the foil is lighter and doesn't have a stiff blade.</p>

  <p>Fencers have to wear protective gear, including a mask, jacket, glove, and chest protector, to ensure safety during bouts.</p>
  
  <p>Foil fencing is typically done in a series of three-minute bouts, with the winner being the first to score 15 points or the fencer with the most points at the end of the time limit.</p>
