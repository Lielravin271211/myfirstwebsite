    <h1>These are the basics that you need to know to fence with a sabre.</h1>

    <p>The sabre is a light cutting and slashing weapon that targets the entire body above the waist, including the arms and head, but not the hands.</p>

    <p>Points are scored by making contact with the edge or the tip of the blade on the opponent's valid target area.</p>

    <p>Sabre fencing follows the rules of "right of way," which means that the fencer who initiates an attack has priority to score a point.</p>

    <p>Sabre fencing is typically done in a series of three-minute bouts, with the winner being the first to score 15 points or the fencer with the most points at the end of the time limit.</p>
